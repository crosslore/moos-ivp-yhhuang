The concept of my algorithm:

1. Declare the Structure: Node, Node is the item looks like     x|y|position
2. Get the input data, transfor the data to double from string, get x,y,id.
3. Use Calculate_min() function to impliment the algorithm 
4. Calculate_min(): Use one while loop,inclding for loop inside, use for loop to calculate the minimum
5. After finish first one, the position now become the point now 
6. Erase the minimum item.
7. While loop will last until the input is empty
